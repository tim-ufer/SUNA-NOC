https://github.com/zweifel/zweifel

After installing the zweifel library, define its path on the Makefile.
In other words, change the following variable in the Makefile to point to zweifel library's correct installing location:
PATH_TO_ZWEIFEL_LIBRARY=/home/user/zweifel

Run make afterwards:
make

It should produce two executables: rl and rl_live.

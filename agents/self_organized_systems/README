--- Growing Explanation ---

should stop growing (see as a TODO):
- useful - when the users are satisfied with the results
- helplessness - even growing, does not improve


For now, the following is IMPLEMENTED:
After growing_turn inputs are entered, the som_map try to grow()
it will effectively grow in size only if the map_error is bigger than the map_threshold

The growing_turn was set directly related to the size (height*width) of the som_map, then it will take more time to occur in bigger som_maps. This is important since the error in bigger som_maps may also take longer to accumulate.

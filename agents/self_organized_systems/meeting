-ASSOM

-PCA (recursive PCA?)

-GSOM + image (edge detection?)
-GSOM + image + subsampling

problem:
-GSOM + image + subsampling + GSOM

objective:
+shape model (loose models, no strict relation between them)
+shape's shapes (shapes within shapes. SIFT and Constellation ideas, relation between shapes are important)
+incorporate color (composite models?)

variances: 
-model differences -> how many SOMs?
-use ASSOM?
-similar photos with different results - illuminance problems? -> contrast enhancement


less important:
-growing problem -> parameters are still hard to define

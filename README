/************************** Changing Environments ********************************************/

Environment can be changed in main.cpp.
For example commenting out where the Reinforcement_Environment is defined and
uncommenting the line with:
Reinforcement_Environment* env= new Double_Cart_Pole(random);


If the environment should be terminated when the maximum steps is reached
uncomment the following in parameters.h:
#define TERMINATE_IF_MAX_STEPS_REACHED		
Do not forget to comment it out when surpassing the maximum number of steps is
not a termination condition! For example, montain car does not need it while
double cart pole does.

/************************** Changing Parameters ********************************************/

Many parameters of the environment as well as of the agent can be changed by modifying some definitions
in parameters.h

/************************** Running Experiments ********************************************/

To run a trial until its maximum number of trials defined in main.cpp, run: 

./rl

To test the best individual, run:

./rl_live dna_best_individual

A series of trials can be run by using the script mean_curve.sh
